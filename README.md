This repo contains my `home` infrastructure defined as Kubernetes helm releases, CRDs, and other set of helper scripts deployed via FluxCD.
The underlying infrastructure is maintained through a whole personal (still private) arsenal of Ansible playbooks and roles to automate my home setup.

I am a firm believer in GitOps and Kubernetes as the defacto cloud orchestrator for running everything as containers in the private and public clouds alike.

## üß¨ Repository structure

The cluster components break down all their services into **6** well-defined "categories" under the [cluster](https://github.com/kitos9112/k8s-home/tree/main/cluster) directory:

- [base](https://github.com/kitos9112/k8s-home/tree/main/cluster/base)
- [sources](https://github.com/kitos9112/k8s-home/tree/main/cluster/sources)
- [crds](https://github.com/kitos9112/k8s-home/tree/main/cluster/crds)
- [core](https://github.com/kitos9112/k8s-home/tree/main/cluster/core)
- [apps](https://github.com/kitos9112/k8s-home/tree/main/cluster/apps)
- [config](https://github.com/kitos9112/k8s-home/tree/main/cluster/config)

### üç≥ GitOps

Flux watches the aforementioned cluster folders in the `main` Git branch. Also, it makes the appropriate changes in the K8s cluster based on the Kustomization and Helm controllers specifications.

### ü§ñ RenovateBot

Med Renovate watches the **entire repository** looking for dependency updates, when they are found, a Pull Request is automatically created (and auto-applied oftentimes).

Personally, I use a Github app under the name of `Henrry PA` that kindly assist me with the PR creation, and fillings.

## Bootstrap cluster using Flux

```sh
flux bootstrap github --branch=main \
                      --components-extra=image-reflector-controller,\
                        image-automation-controller \
                      --personal \
                      --repository=k8s-home \
                      --owner=kitos9112 \
                      --interval=30s \
                      --path=./cluster/base \
                      --token-auth
```

After the aforementioned command is fired off against a nuked cluster, the cluster bootstrapping logic should take place starting with CRDs, sources, and config categories, them moving to core items, whilst finalising with the apps objects.

## Uninstall FluxCD alongside all CRDs

The following CLI command will uninstall FluxCD alongside all CRDs:

```sh
flux uninstall --resources --crds --namespace=flux-system
```

## Troubleshooting - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED (WIP)

A dedicated directory with a set of `runbooks` should live under /docs/troubleshooting.

## Frequently Answered Questions (FAQ)

### Why do K8s namespaces live in a single folder?

This is quite important.
Despite adding extra management overhead, it ensures the namespace **must exist before deploying any K8s objects**.
