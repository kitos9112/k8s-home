# Core

 Made up of applications that become the heart and the foundation of any Kubernetes cluster to fullfil needs as:

- Storage
- Namespace declaration
- Certificate management
- Secret Management
- Monitoring and Observability
- Networking and Load Balancing
- Auto-os K8s worker upgrade
- K8s manifests and Persistent Volume Backup and Restore

They all ensure a well-maintained and secure Kubernetes cluster, each application fulfils a single cause and gets deployed onto its own namespace.
Also, they all depend on **crds** and Flux should never prune them in case a manifest disappears from the source of truth (e.g. Git)

> Each category contains a directory that depicts the Kubernetes namespace where to deploy `kustomize` objects.
